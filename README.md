## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the projects on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanialNejad/ML-2024.git
   cd ML-2024
   \`\`\`

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   \`\`\`bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   \`\`\`

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

## üì¶ Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the projects:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

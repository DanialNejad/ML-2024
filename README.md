## Projects Overview

Each project in this repository demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques and algorithms studied throughout the course. The projects are as follows:

1. [Mini Project 1](#mini-project-1)
2. [Mini Project 2](#mini-project-2)
3. [Mini Project 3](#mini-project-3)
4. [Mini Project 4](#mini-project-4)


## Mini-Project 1: Iris Dataset Analysis and Visualization
This mini-project involves an in-depth analysis and visualization of the Iris dataset. The project includes data exploration, visualization, and the application of PCA for dimensionality reduction. Various visualizations, such as histograms, boxplots, t-SNE, and correlation heatmaps, are created to understand the relationships and distributions of features within the dataset.

## Mini-Project 2: Bearing Fault Detection
In this mini-project, we focus on detecting faults in bearing data. The project includes loading and preprocessing the dataset, extracting features, and applying machine learning models to classify normal and faulty bearings. It also involves hyperparameter tuning, training different models, and evaluating their performance through accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## Mini-Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection
This mini-project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using the credit card dataset. It involves data preprocessing, balancing the dataset using SMOTE, and adding Gaussian noise. An autoencoder is trained to denoise the data, followed by training a classifier model to detect fraud. The project also explores various sampling strategies and thresholds to optimize recall and accuracy.

## Mini-Project 4: Lunar Lander DQN and DDQN
The goal of this mini-project is to train Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) agents to solve the Lunar Lander environment. The project includes setting up the environment, defining the DQN and DDQN architectures, implementing experience replay, and training the agents with different batch sizes. The performance of the agents is evaluated and visualized through rewards and learning curves.

## Installation and Usage

To run the projects on your local machine, you will need to install the necessary Python packages. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanialNejad/ML-2024.git
cd ML-2024

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the projects:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

All the dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

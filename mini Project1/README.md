Question 1 (Q1)
Q1 focuses on generating a synthetic dataset, visualizing it, and applying Logistic Regression and SGDClassifier models. It involves the following steps:

Generating a synthetic dataset using make_classification
Visualizing the dataset in 2D and 3D scatter plots
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
Training and evaluating Logistic Regression and SGDClassifier models
Performing hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Visualizing decision regions and confusion matrices
Question 2 (Q2)
Q2 involves analyzing normal and faulty bearing data, extracting features, and implementing Logistic Regression from scratch. The steps include:

Loading and preparing normal and faulty bearing data
Extracting features such as standard deviation, peak, skewness, etc.
Implementing Logistic Regression from scratch, including binary cross-entropy loss and gradient descent
Training and evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Performing hyperparameter tuning
Visualizing confusion matrices and loss curves
Question 3 (Q3)
Q3 deals with analyzing weather data and implementing various regression models to predict temperature and apparent temperature. The steps include:

Loading and exploring the weather dataset
Visualizing data distributions and relationships
Engineering features for regression models
Implementing and evaluating Linear Regression, Recursive Least Squares, and Weighted Least Squares models
Calculating and visualizing performance metrics such as mean squared error
Plotting actual vs predicted values
